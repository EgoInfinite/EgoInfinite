## Hello Hello, my name is Edgerton, but please call me Edge. 

### I am a Full-Time Student, Full-Stack Developer, and Full-Time Nerd!
- I am currently working on multiple Tabletop Roleplaying Game Systems w/Friends! 🎲👾👽🔫
- In order to do that, I have to learn EVERYTHING! 🤣
- I am always seeking out new friends, allies, and associates, I'm a quick to reply too. 😉

### 2022 Goals (For now...)
- [] Obtain my Associate's Degree in Web Development...
- [] Perfect my own unique design philosophy for designing websites...
- [] Learn more about A.I....
- [] Begin Mastering Angular and pass on that knowledge to my friends...
- [] Do more than just dabble in game design...
